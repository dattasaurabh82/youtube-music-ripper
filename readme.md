##About
A hypersimple Python program to facilitate ripping MP3 audio from YouTube videos. 

##Requirements
For this to work, you must have youtube-dl (http://youtube-dl.org) and ffmpeg installed. I'm going to provide instructions for the Mac, because that's what I and most of my friends use. 

###Install Homebrew
Hombrew is a package manager for Mac. It helps you install command line programs in a very useful manner. More info at http://brew.sh. 

If you don't already have it installed, open Terminal and copy/paste: 

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"`

and follow the instructions. 

###Install youtube-dl 
youtube-dl is a python library designed to interact with YouTube from the command line. More info at http://youtube-dl.org. 

You'll want to follow the download instructions on http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html. If you don't know what any of this text means, the best solution is probably to copy/paste the following into Terminal: 

`sudo curl https://yt-dl.org/downloads/2014.02.13/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl`

and then: 

`sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl`

**Note: the link above is current at the date I committed this. It will almost certainly be updated when you read it, so don't copy/paste it from this page without checking to get the right one**

###Install ffmpeg 
ffmpeg is a framework to convert between media types. You can learn more at http://www.ffmpeg.org/about.html. 

Having installed Homebrew, you can easily install ffmpeg by copy/pasting: 

`brew install ffmpeg --devel` 

##How it works 
Everything in this program is run by ripper.py, which you can use in the following way: 

* Download it to your preferred folder / directory (where all your music will appear too!)
* Open up terminal and navigate to the directory where ripper.py is 
* Type `python ripper.py` into terminal
* Answer the prompts according to your fondest hopes and desires 
* MP3 files should begin appearing where you want them to!
